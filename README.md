# User list app - UI

## Practical-4

- Create a dummy project named “user-list-react-app” in react using any of the above methods - CRA or webpack from scratch.
- The card on the right is the card that will appear on hovering over a user. This card will be containing details of the user which we hovered over.
- Use static dummy data for the user list for now.
- The user in the first row should have “Active” as status and “owner” as access in the list always, with a lock sign icon instead of a dust bin icon.

## Setup Project Environment

- install all packages

  > ` npm install` :

- write below command
  > `npm run dev` : Start project on default Port
  >
  > - running npm run dev will start a development server that serves the Vite application and watches for changes to the code.
  > - Specifically, npm run dev will run the vite command with the --mode development option, which starts a development server that uses the Vite build tool to serve the application.
  > - As you make changes to the code, Vite will detect those changes and automatically rebuild and reload the application in the browser. Vite uses a fast and efficient development server that leverages browser-native ES modules to avoid expensive transpilation and bundling steps during development, which makes it faster and more responsive than many other development servers.
